Description: The R package provides utilities to estimate and make inference on 
    the ROC curve analysis for continuous diagnostic tests in presence 
    of vification bias. The verification mechanism is assumed as missing at 
    random (MAR). This package consist of the methods to estimate AUC and ROC: 
    full imputation--FI, mean score imputation--MSI, 
    inverse probability weighting--IPW, doubly robust--DR). 
    The asymptotic variance of the estimates also are calculated.
